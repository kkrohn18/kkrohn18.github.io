UFC Picks is a web app I created for people to make predictions about UFC fights and score points for correct predictions. (Think Fantasy football, but for UFC)

I created [UFC Picks](https://ufcpicks.herokuapp.com) using Python/Django.

I chose [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) because I really wanted to start learning a Python web development framework, and Django is a full-stack framework that has a quick development time.

I chose Heroku's free tier for cloud hosting. Heroku offers a free tier that gives you a limited monthly uptime for your server, and the server goes to "sleep" after 30 minutes of inactivity (hence the long initial load time if the server was not active before hand.)

Here are some screen shots of UFC Picks, or you can check it out yourself by going to [https://ufcpicks.herokuapp.com]https://ufcpicks.herokuapp.com
